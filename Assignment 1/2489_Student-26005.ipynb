    "The first and second parameter takes the lat/lon of your preferred location and the third parameter takes the date as well as the opening of DJIA on that day, connected by `-`.\n",

    "The number $e$, known as [Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) (named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler), is a mathematical constant.  It is the base of the natural logarithm. It is the limit of $(1 + \\frac{1}{n})^n$ as $n$ approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest, as your all know from your economics/finance 101 course.\n",

    "Now let's stand on the giant's shoulder to get our own $e$. To do so, you need to write a function ```factorial``` to calculate the factorial number given the $n$ and then use ```for loop``` to generate the $e$. Let $n$ go from 0 to 10, and save the derived value of $e$ in a list and print it out when n is an odd number (up to 10).\n",

    "### Question 3 (25 points) Binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a classical search method. Given a sorted list of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in the list. Specifically, searching a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n",
